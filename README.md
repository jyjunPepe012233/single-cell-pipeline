# Introductory Single-Cell Data Analysis Pipeline

This project is designed to simulate how a researcher
is introduced to single-cell data analysis in a real R&D team.

The goal is not to perform advanced bioinformatics analysis,
but to understand the learning structure:
how data is explored, cleaned, evaluated, and interpreted step by step.
